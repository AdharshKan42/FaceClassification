# FaceClassification

Human Classification time >:)

## Large Scale Project Plan:
- Drone takes selfie of group  
    - Recognizes people within camera frame
    - Classifies them as certain predetermined people
    - Face Similarity check: Checks if they're part of no-no database
- Relays information to base station or online (using WebRTC?)
- Models could be hosted on AWS or other cloud platform, server?
- Sends results to base station which sends texts/emails of image to the right people

### Extensions:
- WebRTC
- Working Mobile App for control and classification

## Phase 1:
- Face Recognition in Camera Feed
- Face Classification compared to premade datasets

## TODO:
